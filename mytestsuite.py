# For testing.
#
# Concept: This module allows to trigger abnormal situations, to test the reaction of the software ("fault insertion testing").
# In the place in the software, where the fault shall be injected, add a condition like
#     if (testsuite_faultinjection_is_triggered(TC_MY_TESTCASE_FOR_SOMETHING)):
#         DoSomethingStrange()
# In normal software run, this condition is never fulfilled and does not disturb. If the related test case is activated,
# by setting testsuite_testcase_number = TC_MY_TESTCASE_FOR_SOMETHING below, the condition will fire and the fault is injected.
# A number of delay cycles can be configured with testsuite_delayCycles below.
#
# Detailled docu see doc/testing_and_simulation.md
